# Changelog

All notable changes to `gladekit-mcp` are documented here. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-18

### Changed

- **`openai` and `numpy` are now default dependencies.** Script semantic search works out of the box as soon as `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set — no install flags needed. Previously these packages shipped behind the `[search]` extra, which caused silent fallback to unranked results when users set the key without first reinstalling with the extra.

### Removed

- **Dropped `[search]` and `[all]` optional-dependency extras.** They are now redundant. If your install command includes `gladekit-mcp[search]` or `gladekit-mcp[all]`, drop the suffix — plain `gladekit-mcp` now bundles everything the `[search]` extra contained. The `[http]` extra is retained for explicit pinning of `starlette`/`uvicorn`.

### Migration

No config changes required. If you previously launched the server with:

```json
{ "command": "uvx", "args": ["gladekit-mcp[search]"] }
```

simplify to:

```json
{ "command": "uvx", "args": ["gladekit-mcp"] }
```

Semantic search activates automatically when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is present in the `env` block.
